DPJ Parser/AST:  TODO
=====================

Add support for index variable substitutions in generic regions and
types
- In class definitions
  (a) #i can appear after the class name and parameters
  (b) If (a) holds, then #i can appear after any type or region parameter
- In explicit types
  (a) #i can appear after the type
  (b) If (a) holds, then i can appear in any integer position in the type
- In type and region variables
  - If #i appears after the variable in its declaration, then #i can
     appear after the variable in its use

Add support for region parameter substitutions in generic regions and
types
- Same as above, except we write '##P' instead of '#i', and P can
  appear in a region parameter position, instead of i appearing in an
  integer position

Add support for generic effects
- Effect parameter declarations
- Effect constraints
- Effect uses at method summary in addition to 'reads' and 'writes'


Add support for 'invokes' at method summary (lower priority)
