This document explains how to install Deterministic Parallel Java
(DPJ), so you can use it to compile and run programs.  It also
explains how to build DPJ from source code, in case you wish to study
and/or modify the compiler internals.  A working knowledge of Java is
required. Please also consult \tutorial\ and \refmanual\ for
further details about the language.

The instructions in this document assume that you are working in a
UNIX-like system (including Linux, Mac OS X, etc.).  Everything should
work in Windows, but we have not tested DPJ on Windows systems.  To
follow the instructions as stated here, you will have to install
Cygwin on your Windows system to get a UNIX-like interface and tool
set.
