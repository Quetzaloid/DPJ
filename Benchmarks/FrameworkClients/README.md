Framework Client Code
=====================

Rob Bocchino, August 2010

Revised January 2013

This directory contains some client code using parallel frameworks
built with DPJ's API checking support.  The frameworks themselves are
located in 

    `${DPJ_ROOT}/Implementation/Runtime/dpj`

We have also implemented the Monte Carlo benchmark from the Java
Grande suite in this way.  That benchmark is located at

    `${DPJ-ROOT}/Benchmarks/Applications/MonteCarlo/DisjointArray`
