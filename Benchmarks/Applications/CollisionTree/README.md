DPJ Collision Tree Benchmark
============================

To build the benchmark, say `ant`.

To run the benchmark, say `ant run`.

This should work inside Eclipse, but you have to make sure that
DPJ_ROOT is correctly set.  On OS X, Eclipse won't pick up the
DPJ_ROOT environment variable from your shell.
